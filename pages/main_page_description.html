  Although the system is similar to Google Analytics, it features unique
  functionality for working with traders:

    <p>
      Finteza is the only service which can provide an end-to-end out-of-the-box
      analytics. Find out the real client attraction cost, optimize marketing
      channels and boost ROI and LTV.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service is tightly integrated with MetaTrader 4/5 platforms: all
      actions of a potential client are recorded starting from the first site
      visit, while further statistics are collected directly from the platform.
      You can check the budget spent to attract and encourage the client, as
      well as your resulting profits.

      With the built-in traffic attribution, third-party services are no longer
      needed and thus you can save on your marketing budget. Finteza registers
      all sources, supports different attribution models and shows conversion
      rates from your website and platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      15 reports are available for comprehensive analysis. In addition to
      conversion sources, you can analyze audience characteristics (geography,
      devices and platform, among others) as well as trader behavior (pages,
      events in the platform and on the site, bounce rate, detailed user logs
      and other relevant data).

      Bot detector will analyze the quality of your purchased advertising
      traffic. It will show the amount of fake users and will help in
      determining reasons for low conversion rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      To compile traffic quality reports, the system checks blacklists to detect
      spammers, bot farms and DDoS attackers, as well as analyzes each user
      behavior in your app or site.

      Detailed yet easy-to-use sales funnels can show lead and client loss
      points. You will be able to optimize weak stages and increase the
      efficiency of your marketing spendings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system registers website and platform user behavior, groups users by
      attraction channels and generates comprehensive reports. Based on detected
      conversion loss points, you will be able to optimize your site and boost
      profits.

      Bonus: built-in advertising engine with the retargeting function.
      Encourage your traders to make a deposit, to open a new account or to join
      a promotion. These processes are fast and easy with the integrated ad
      system. Using the retargeting option, you can display the right message at
      the right time and thus maximize the efficiency of trader engagement
      campaigns.
